# XLSX Accessibility Checker

This is version of the accessibility checker, exported from Observable (https://observablehq.com/@jtrim-ons/xlsx-accessibility-checker).

It can be run on a local web server.

## Notes on how I've modified this after exporting from Observable

I've tweaked index.html.  I also re-ordered some of the cells to put the styles early and named a cell `"start_of_appendix"`.

I've edited runtime.js to get scripts from lib/ rather than the jsdelivr service.
